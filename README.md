Azure API -> Terraform Resources

## Overview
----
This is a work in progress initiative to create a CLI tool to generate Terraform definitions for Azure resources. The idea for this came about when teams I've worked with had existing Azure resources but were lacking terraform definitions. As a result, this slowed down their time to production.

## TODO
This project is just getting started, so stay tuned for the intitial implementation!
